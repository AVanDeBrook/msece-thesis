    Data is organized into `trs` files (follows an XML standard). Details in `~parse_transcripts` function.

    Dataset can be obtained here: https://lindat.mff.cuni.cz/repository/xmlui/handle/11858/00-097C-0000-0001-CCA1-0

    Notes:
        - As useful as this dataset may be, the transcriptions and their format are so convoluted and different from
          the other datasets that it may not be worth using
        - There are a lot of non-english tokens in this data that I am not sure how to filter out
        - All number readouts are space separated
        - **I'll keep working on this script to normalize the data, but I'm exluding it from the training data for now**
        - Examples of problematic lines:

        Since the transcript files correspond to wav files for ASR tasks, the transcriptions are organized into
        <Sync> elements with time attributes e.g. <Sync time="1.900"/>. In this case the time attribute is ignored
        and only the text is extracted. The node hierarchy is as follows:
            * <Trans> -- root node
            * <Episode> -- empty tag (organizational?)
            * <Section> -- metadata, similar to <Turn>
            * <Turn> -- contains metadata about the duration of the audio file (attributes), serves as parent for <Sync> nodes
            * <Sync> -- holds the time (attribute) and text info (tail)

        There are also transcriber annotations present in the text, usually following a form similar to other transcripts
        for example:
            * [air]
            * [ground]
            * [unintelligible]
